          What makes a song a good song, according to me?
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The hook has to be catchy enough, no matter the genre.</li>
        <li>I always like a song with a nice underlying meaning!</li>
        <li>What's the personal significance to me or people I know? I like listening to songs that I, or others, have said that they can relate to.</li>

      <h1>
        My Top Ten (and why)*:
       
      </h1> 
      *This is in no particular order!
      <ol>
        <li>DuckWorth- Kendrick Lamar. Really powerful song, really like the lyrics, and i=the instrumental is literally amazing.</li>
        
        <li>Army Dreamers/Suspended In Gaffa-Kate Bush. Both of those songs sre in the same part of my brain. I love Kate's music as a whole, her voice is very recognizable!</li>
        
        <li>Pink Matter-Frank Ocean. I already love Frank's voice, and this song really highlights it. The entirety of Channel Orange is amazing, but this song is just so good. And, I love ANDRE 3000!</li>
        <li>Midsection- KAYTRANADA, Pharrell Williams. I don't know if this is always gonna be on my list, but I love it a lot right now. It sounds very funky! I really like it.</li>
        <li> Everything She Wants-WHAM! I love WHAM. I love their voices, I like the look, the aesthetic, the hair. But this song..is just too good to not put up here.</li>
        <li>La Camisa Negra-Juanes. I really, really like his voice. This song feels very dance heavy, based on how it sounds, and I can't help but sway!</li>
        <li> Alright-Kendrick Lamar. It's very politically relevant, every single time I listen to it. It really excites me that the song is so moving.</li>
        <li> Doo Wop (That Thing)-Lauryn Hill. Her voice is gorgeous, and I became aware of her through my mom! This  song means a lot to me, personally.</li>
        <li>Me and Your Mama-childish Gambino. I just love the intrumental, it's so addicting. It's kinda spooky too, and I like spooky songs.</li>
        <li>Redbone-Chilsih Gambino. Again, I don't know if he produces them himself, but WOW. The beats and the way his voice sounds is so addicting. He's so cool.</li>
      </ol>
